### 🧠 What is LangSmith?
    LangSmith is a tool for debugging, testing, and monitoring LLM (Large Language Model) applications.Think of it as the "developer console" for your AI apps. It helps you: Trace how your chain or agent runs (step-by-step).Log inputs/outputs for each step of your app.Visualize errors or performance issues.Collaborate with your team by saving and sharing traces.
    
Fine-tune prompts by comparing outputs.
### 💡 Use Case: Debug and Monitor a Q&A Chain with LangSmith
- Let's take your current Q&A app and integrate LangSmith to trace and debug it.

### 🔍 What You Get in LangSmith Dashboard
- Once you run this, visit: https://smith.langchain.com

- You’ll see:
    The full trace of how your chain executed.
    Input/Output at each step.
    Any errors if they occurred.
    Latency and performance metrics.

✅ 1. Can we set input/output token limits?
Yes, absolutely.

🔹 Input Token Limit
You can truncate or summarize your context before passing it to the model.

This is manual: You decide how many tokens/words to allow.

🔹 Output Token Limit
You can set max_tokens in the model config to limit output length.

⚖️ 2. Is limiting tokens a good idea?
👍 Yes, because:	👎 But be careful:
Speeds up response time	Truncating input may lose context
Reduces cost	Too small output limit may cut off text
Keeps summaries short and useful	May affect accuracy or detail

So yes — for summarization, you want short and focused output, which means setting a lower max_tokens is a good idea.


### 🔚 Summary
Tip	Why it matters
Use max_tokens	To limit length of model output
Give clear prompt ("short")	Helps model understand goal
Preprocess long inputs	Truncate or summarize before passing in


### 🔍 Problem
Your model output is still too long or breaks mid-sentence, like this:

"... it also notes that speech can reveal"

This happens because:

max_tokens is too low to finish the thought

or the prompt doesn’t clearly enforce brevity
✅ Solution: Make It Short and Complete
🛠️ 1. Adjust Prompt to FORCE brevity
🛠️ 2. Limit output tokens better
🧪 Example Result (Expected)
“Speech uses the human voice to form words and express intent. It also reflects identity through tone and delivery.”

✅ Short, complete, and accurate.
💡 Extra Tip: Add temperature=0.3 to make it more focused


Still the text is cutting
Given the challenges you're facing with the model cutting off mid-sentence, let's delve deeper into potential solutions and best practices to address this issue effectively.
### 🔍 Understanding the Issue
When a model's response cuts off mid-sentence, it often indicates that the output token limit (max_tokens) is set too low, preventing the model from completing its thought. Additionally, if the input context is lengthy, it consumes a significant portion of the available tokens, leaving insufficient space for a complete response.

### ✅ Solutions to Prevent Mid-Sentence Cutoffs
1. Increase the Output Token Limit
2. Optimize Input Length
3. Implement Stop Sequences
4. Adjust Sampling Parameters


### 🧠 Additional Tips
- Monitor Token Usage: Keep track of the total tokens used (input + output) to ensure they don't exceed the model's maximum token limit.
- Iterative Refinement: If the output is still not satisfactory, experiment with different prompt formulations or sampling parameters.
- Model Capabilities: Be aware of the specific token limits and capabilities of the model you're using to avoid unexpected truncation.
