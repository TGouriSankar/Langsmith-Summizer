# üß† LangSmith Summizer

**LangSmith Summizer** is a Python-based application designed to efficiently summarize extensive textual content into concise 1‚Äì2 line summaries using LangChain and LangSmith frameworks.

## üöß Problem Encountered

While developing the summarization feature, the application exhibited the following issues:

* **Excessive Output Length**: The model generated verbose responses, exceeding the desired summary length.
* **Unintended Responses**: Occasionally, the model returned `<think>` outputs, indicating uncertainty or the need for further information.
* **Token Limitations**: Processing large documents led to token overflow errors, causing incomplete summaries.

## üîß Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Refined Prompt Engineering**

To guide the model towards generating concise summaries, the prompt was explicitly defined:

```python
map_template = """Summarize the following content into a concise 1‚Äì2 line summary:

{content}

Summary:
"""
```

This structured prompt set clear expectations for the model's output.

### 2. **Chunking Large Inputs**

To handle extensive documents and adhere to token limits, the input text was divided into manageable chunks:

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=3000,
    chunk_overlap=500,
    separators=["\n\n", "\n", " ", ""]
)

chunks = text_splitter.split_text(context)
```

Each chunk was processed individually, ensuring that the model could handle large inputs without exceeding token limits.

### 3. **Implemented Stop Sequences**

To prevent the model from generating excessive text, stop sequences were defined:

```python
stop_sequence = ["\n", "END"]
```

This configuration instructed the model to halt generation upon encountering a newline character or the word "END", ensuring concise outputs.

### 4. **Optimized Sampling Parameters**

To further refine the output and ensure brevity, the model's sampling parameters were adjusted:

```python
llm = ChatGroq(
    model="qwen-qwq-32b",
    max_tokens=100,
    temperature=0.3,
    top_p=0.9,
    top_k=50,
    stop=stop_sequence
)
```

This setup promoted focused and deterministic responses.

### 5. **Error Handling for Summary Extraction**

To address potential issues with summary extraction, the following error handling was implemented:

```python
summaries = [
    map_chain.invoke({"content": chunk}).get("text", "Summary not available")
    for chunk in chunks
]
```

This approach ensured that missing or malformed summaries were gracefully handled.

## üß† LangSmith Integration

To debug and monitor the application's behavior, LangSmith was integrated:

1. **Enable Tracing**: Set environment variables to enable tracing:

   ```bash
   export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
   export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   ```

2. **Initialize Client**: In the application code, initialize the LangSmith client:

   ```python
   from langsmith import Client

   client = Client()
   ```

3. **Create Project**: Create a new project for the application:

   ```python
   session = client.create_project(
       project_name="LangSmith Summizer",
       description="A project that summarizes large texts into concise summaries"
   )
   ```

4. **Set Project**: Set the created project as the default:

   ```python
   os.environ["LANGCHAIN_PROJECT"] = "LangSmith Summizer"
   ```

By integrating LangSmith, detailed traces of the application's execution were logged, allowing for visualization and debugging through the LangSmith dashboard.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
